Backup-Since all the participants<?='&#39;'?> documents are duplicated many times over TradeFinex blockchain, they always enjoy free backup. Safety-Cryptography (the technology of encrypting websites) ensures TradeFinex is never hacked and therefore, participants are safe in every aspect. Speed-Since smart contracts deploy a software code to automate tasks, participants save hours of time that would otherwise go towards manually processing all paperwork. Savings-Since there is no intermediary or third party, participants save big on fees paid to notary and more. Accuracy-Since everything is done digitally, the possibility of human error is automatically ruled out, hence the accuracy. </div>

Backup-Since all the participants<?='&#39;'?> documents are duplicated many times over TradeFinex blockchain, they always enjoy free backup. Safety-Cryptography (the technology of encrypting websites) ensures TradeFinex is never hacked and therefore, participants are safe in every aspect. Speed-Since smart contracts deploy a software code to automate tasks, participants save hours of time that would otherwise go towards manually processing all paperwork. Savings-Since there is no intermediary or third party, participants save big on fees paid to notary and more. Accuracy-Since everything is done digitally, the possibility of human error is automatically ruled out, hence the accuracy.

Upon reaching an agreement, each party using their cryptographic key, unique to them can sign off on the contract.
